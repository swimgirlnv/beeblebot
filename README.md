For ENGL 1050J: Multimedia Storytelling

> A Thousand Words
> Tell a story that makes significant and meaningful use of images.
> The goal of this assignment is less about making a perfect piece and more about exposing yourself to new possibilities and figuring out a workflow that works for you. You will take this story through three iterations: a workshop draft, a final edited version, and a brief presentation. 
> While there is no length requirement, your project should reflect a sustained and substantial effort of at least twelve hours.


I chose to focus on the topic of keeping bears wild in Lake Tahoe. My hope is to raise awareness, sympathy, and empathy among would-be tourists in the area to be mindful of their trash and keeping the lake and the surrounding nature clean.

All images and videos are from online searches for bears in tahoe.
